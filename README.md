Dream Frame offers customization like custom background, colors, fonts, and blur adjustments. One of the best translucent themes out there for Powercord and BetterDiscord.

## Features
 ### Custom Background
 Use an image URL from popular image providers to set whatever background you want that fill the whole screen. Set blur, opacity, rotation, and other adjustments to the background. 
 ### Custom Colors
 You can set an accent color to whatever you like best, instead of seeing Discord's default accent color known as blurple and also set accent text color.
 ### Profile Covers
 Dream Frame is one of the themes to support [profile covers](https://github.com/Discord-Custom-Covers/usrbg). Go to [Dream Frame's](https://discord.gg/Grya2sa) or [Black Box's](https://discord.gg/TeRQEPb) support server and request a background cover for your profile. You can also view other's covers too by viewing their profiles.

## Discord Mod Support
Dream Frame supports both [Powercord](https://Powercord.dev) and [BetterDiscord]().
It is recommended to use Dream Frame on Discord Canary until `backdrop-filter` is supported on Discord Stable.
